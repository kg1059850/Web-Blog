Sorry, but nope. Since being labeled as reckless a couple of months back, he hasn't been the same. Or at least his finishes haven't. Into summer, he lived in the top 10, and now he can't sniff it.

He's with a Childress Racing team he plans to leave after next year, which is weird enough.

He's excellent on road courses and quite proficient so far at plate-races. If he can get through the first three-race cutoff, the second round has one of each.
